2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Size, color, and animation guide user attention
3. **Feedback**: Every interaction provides visual feedback
4. **Consistency**: Same timing, colors, and patterns throughout
5. **Performance**: Optimized animations for smooth 60fps
6. **Accessibility**: Respects reduced motion preferences

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If animations don't appear:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify MUI version is 5.14.0+

### If performance is slow:
1. Reduce particle count (20 → 10)
2. Disable some animations on mobile
3. Check CPU usage in browser DevTools
